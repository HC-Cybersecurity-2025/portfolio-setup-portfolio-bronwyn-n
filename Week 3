## Purpose
This artifact is what is important in computer security. There are many things that can happen to your computer or software, because of hackers.

## What I did
There are many different kinds of malware that can occur. One of them is a logic bomb. I have some research of a few of the infamous logic bombs and have
learned a lot. These are malicious malware that occurs when someone plants code in the software and it waits for something to occur to make a reaction.
Some of the things that could occur is user actions, system conditions, event bases triggers, or even date or time.
 
## Reflection
These stay dormant until triggered. So you have no idea if you would have a logic bomb. This makes it important to keep your account and computer secure and 
protected so there would be no way for a logic bomb. The purpose for logic bombs are to cause harm, delete, corrupt, or steal your own personal information.
A couple examples of logic bombs are Duronio's logic bomb, stuxnet, and SQL slammer. Some of the aftermath of logic bombs are data loss, financial losses, 
operational downtime, reputation damage, data breaches, online property theft, national security risks, system disruption,compliance issues, and investigation
and recovery costs. This takes a huge toll on the system that has had a logic bomb harm their software. It is so important to secure your systems by cloud storage,
data backups, an extra hard disk drive, external USB storage device, continuous cloud backup, and of course a strong security.
