# CYBR-1100 • Week ## • Case Project 6-2
 
**Student:** Bronwyn Nelson 
**Date:** 2025-10-05
 
## Purpose
This is going to explain the current privacy laws in Ohio. 
 
## Evidence
 
## What I did
I was reading the information on the Securiti website about data protection and data privacy laws. It says there isn't a comprehensive law but there are some laws like HIPAA,
COPPA, GLBA, and FCRA. These are all implied laws that are important no matter where and what is being done with the information. 
 
## Reflection
Even though there is no comprehensive laws, there are applicaple laws that are important to be followed. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act makes any 
business that is in healthcare, abide by laws dealing with protected health information of individuals. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act focusing on protecting
minors personal and sensitive data across the U.S.. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act mandates financial institution inform customers about data sharing and protecting sensitive
information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act controls consumer credit report which requires businesses to ensure accurate handling of peoples credit data. There are some
practices that help with your business to be safe. You can enable data mapping automation that will help you understand data flow across systems. You can establish incident-
response procedures that can allow notifications with coordination with law enforcements. They can provide clear and accessible privacy notices and consents, especially 
students or minors. Trainging their employees that have access to sensitive data about secure handling practices and cybersecurity hygiene.
