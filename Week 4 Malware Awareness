## What I did
I have done a few activities learning how to look for possible malware and how to prevent from falling for the hackers' trap. I think everyone should know how to spot
these malicious emails or links. These hackers can use big corpoation names or your softwares system to convince you it is real. However, there are certain things that
you can look for to know it is a scam. Some of these include misspelling, wrong names, weird links, offering prizes or money. 
 
## Reflection
I have learned these scams are real and need to be watched for. Logic bombs can create data theft, system disruption, espioange, sabotage, or have financial gain.
If you receive an email and it states to be some big company, bank, system programmer, or stating that you are a winner of some kind, it is very possible for it to be a
scam and they are waiting for you to give in and reveal personal information. These scams can just be a link on these emails. This link can ask for personal information
like bank information, social security number, addresses, credit card numbers, and more. It is important to be awareness of these scams so your information or accounts
are not compromised. Three malware prevention tips are keeping your computer and software up to date, limit your file sharing, and don't click or view any type of link or 
photo that you receive through these emails or pop ups. You should use strong passwords, use multi factor authentication, firewalls, antivirus software, and caution what
you click or information that you share.
