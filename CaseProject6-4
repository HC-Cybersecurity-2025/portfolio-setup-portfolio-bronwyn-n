## Purpose
This is going to show examples of how VPN has stored user information. As well as other information about different VPNs. 
 
## Evidence
 
## What I did
An example of VPN storing users data is seven VPNs that are based in Hong Kong. These include UFO VPN, fast VPN, free VPN, super VPN, flash VPN, secure VPN, RABBIT VPN.
It is said that the server contained 1.2TB of data that included users names, user passwords, email addresses, and home addresses. There was also stored acitivity logs 
which shows what websites they were on. I research three VPN and see if it says that they do or don't store user information.
 
## Reflection
This is alarming because most people download and use VPN to secure their privacy. All of these VPNs says that they do not track 
any information but this is by far from the truth of what they are doing. Proton VPN says that they do not store or collect information such as traffic logs, IP addresses,
bandwidth, or browsing data. TunnelBear VPN is another one that states that they do not monitor, log, or sell your information, including browsing activity. ExpressVPN 
states that they do not collect or store information including browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or connection logs. You could verifiy these VPN by 
using a leak test that is available online, there is one on ExpressVPN wesbite. Based on what I learned I would pick TunnelBear VPN.
