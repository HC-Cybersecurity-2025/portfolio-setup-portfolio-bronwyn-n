## What I did
- I decided to listen to some podcasts about cybersecurity and hear how other people view it. 
- I found one that was about his whole career that he taught himself at 13 years of age and how he has changed to hacking for good intentions.
- He also talks about how the popular platform TikTok is dangerous and how to protect yourself.
 
## Reflection
Ryan Montgomery was on a podcast talking about his career in cybersecurity. He taught himself at a very young age and did not have the best intentions at first. He then started to come
across websites that has older adults talking to younger children inappropriately. He then starting hacking to take these people down for doing such a terrible thing. He has even 
put some in prison, and he continues to take these types of websites down. Sometimes he tries to get people to make it public but they won't because of liability reasons. Ryan then 
goes to talk about Tik Tok about how parents should know what their children are doing on the app. Your data can be hacked by searching something on the app or if you have something
copied to your clipboard. He mentions how sometimes you can think about something, not even speak about it, and it will pop up on your socials like someone knew you were interested in 
it. This is very weird to me because it's so true and I wonder how that even happens and then he talked about it on the podcast. Ryan says how the internet is not the same as it 
was 10 years ago, even 5 years ago. It has evolved so much and everyone should be careful when they are connected to the web. He even hacks the hosts ipad on the podcast live. This 
opened my eyes because you really do need to be careful while on the internet. Nothing on the internet is private.
