# CYBR-1100 • Week 7 • Case Project 6-1
 
**Student:** Bronwyn Nelson

## Purpose
This is a survery about privacy to a few of my family/friends. 
 
## Evidence
- Link(s) to files/screenshots (hosted in your repo).  
 
## What I did
All my friends know what location services are. They did not know what MAID was. They did not know what surveillance-based advertisers were. None of them are in school,
  so the school does not monitor anything they have on their smartphones. They all did say how they know nothing is private on the internet or on your smartphone. They 
  know it is important to have strong passwords so your accounts are not hacked by someone. 
 
## Reflection
I have learned that more people need to know the importance of their own security. These are all important things that everyone should be aware of. The MAID number is 
  a 32 long number that is assigned to every single mobile device. The use of MAIDs are for developers to target their audience better. Surveillance-based advertisers
  are advertisements that are based on the users interests, demographics, or activities on their smart device. Location services helps to find the location of your
smartphone. This is important because your phones location is always known.
