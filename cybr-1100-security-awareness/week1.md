# Week 1 â€“ Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
Week one was mostly about what cybersecurity is and the different components that make this up. There are key steps that you should follow to know how and what to expect if there was
an attack on your system.

**Reflection:**  
I learned that there are many parts as to what cybersecurity means. There are many different kinds of hackers and these are called threat actors. There are seven different types 
including cybercriminals, script kiddies, brokers, insiders, cyberterrorists, hactivists, and state actors. They all have a different motive as to why they want to hack these systems. 
It is very hard to completely reject any attack. There are multiple things one can do to protect and make it challenging for the attacker. This includes blocking attacks, updating 
defenses, minimize losses, use layers, and staying alert for attacks that may occur. This is all important to know because anything that they can take or steal is still confidential 
information that they did not have access to. 

Some examples in everyday life for me personally would be doing online shopping. I save my card on file to make it easier when all someone could do was hack into my account and spend
the money however they want. However, before the purchase goes through, it will ask for your security code that only you would have since it is on the physical card. This is an 
example of the checkout process and how it has layers of security. 

**AI Use Note:**  
I did not use any AI technology.
