# CYBR-1100 • Week 5 • Lab B Activities
 
**Student:** Bronwyn Nelson 
**Date:** 2025-09-20
 
## Purpose
I google searched my name to see what I could find. I researched laws in my city and the state of Ohio.
 
## Evidence
- https://ibb.co/whT8t7SS 

## What I did
I searched my name on google and the first thing was my facebook profile. I also seen other people with the name Bronwyn Nelson around the
world. I found my high school Hudl highlights from basketball. I searched the laws that are in my city. One of the most absurd city laws is 
certain fence height. It has to be 4 feet or less in the front and it has to be 6 feet or less towards the sides or back of the house. One absurd
law in Ohio is for honking your horn. It is mandatory to honk your horn while passing another driver. 
 
## Reflection
I have learned that there are so many other people wiht the same name as you. More than you would think, especially if you don't have a common
name. I also looked into laws that are in my city and then some in the state of Ohio. It is mandatory to honk your horn while passing another
driver. I did not know about this law and now I do for researching this. The city of Jackson has a law about fence heights. In the front of your 
house it cannot exceed 4 feet. In the back or sides of your house it cannot exceed 6 feet. I was not aware of this law either. This is more 
information that I now have knowledge about. Since I didn't know these, I wonder how many other laws that I don't know are out there, in my city 
and the state of Ohio.
