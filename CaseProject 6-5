## Purpose
I have learned about the best practices for privacy and security. For this project, I am going to rate some of these practices of the strength of it. 
 
## Evidence
 
## What I did
Your privacy can not be 100 percent secure enough that you don't have to worry about your accounts being hacked. Instead there are practices that you can do to make your account strong enough that the hackers won't want to keep trying. The less secure your
account is the easier it is for hackers to gain access to your information. 
 
## Reflection
One of the best practices that you can do is have a very strong password on your accounts. I would rate this as a 2 as strength on a scale of 1-5, 5 as in the worst. I would also say that rating this as how likely I am to agree and use this practice as a A, on 
a scale of A-F, F being the worst. Another good practice is having multifactor authentication. This is good because if someone would hack your password, there are still other questions or things to complete before you can gain access to the actual account and
information. I would rate this practice a 2A as well. Another practice is regular software updates on your device. It is so important to keep up to date with updates on all your smart devices. Updates are sent out because there has been a vulnerability found
within the software. This means that the vulnerability needs to be fixed, or updated, as soon as the update becomes available. This will patch the "hole" that the hackers would have access to gain access to your information. I would rate this practice as a 1A. 
Another important factor is when you download apps, you make sure the app permissions are on what they should be. Permissions like location, data sharing, and running time. This would be rated as a 3B. Backing up your data regularly is important to keep all your
information in one place and secure. This is important incase you would get hacked or if a virus would go through and delete a bunch of your files that you have. I would rate this as a 3C. I asked a couple people and they rated them that they shoud all be the best
strength and very important so they were all 1A. Three more additional privacy practies would be to limit what you share on social media. Another one is to be careful and picky when choosing to accept a friend request, especially if you don't know them. These two
kinda go along with each other since it it about social media. You never want to accept a friend request from someone you don't know because you don't know what their intentions are. They could be trying to gain information about you through social medias and that
is important to be known. WShen sharing information, make sure you aren't posting that you are away on vacation because this makes you a target for someone that wants to steal or do something to your house since they know you are gone. It would be best to post these
vacation pictures after you have returned home. Another good practice would be to be aware of the information that you have on your device. Knowing what you have will help you to realize if something is missing or deleted. This is important if your device would have
a virus that you aren't aware of. This would be good if you had a backup of all information and data on a flashdrive that would be secure somewhere. This would keep all information that you have, and it should be done regularly as more files are on your computer.
