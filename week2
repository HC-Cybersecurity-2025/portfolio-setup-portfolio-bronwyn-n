## Purpose
This artifact is to show how strong your password is. There are websites that you can use to test the strength of your password.
 
## Evidence
- https://cyber.org/find-curricula/test-strength-your-passwords
- https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/
- http://password-checker.online-domain-tools.com/

## What I did
I used three different websites to test my password strength. Not every single website is going to give you the same answer about your password.
The website "How Secure is My Password," said it would take 34,000 years to crack my password that I use for a lot of my accounts. The website
"Password Checker Online," stated my password strength was 77% and it would take 459 millon years to crack. The website "Cyber.org," said it would 
take 31 centures to crack. This makes me feel better about my password and that it will not be easy to crack for hackers. 
 
## Reflection
I have learned that hackers will generate a bunch of passwords and then try to access your accounts with these passwords. They use the most easy
and obvious passwords that people would use. So if my account doesn't use one of these easy ones, they usually just move on to other accounts that 
they can get access to easier with these passwords. I also put my first ever password in that I created my accounts with and these websites said that
it would take 1 day to a week to crack. So knowing my passwords are way stronger than what I used to use makes me feel more secure with my security.
It is important to make sure your acccounts are strong and secure so hackers can not access your personal information.
