## Purpose
This is going to explain apple security since 2010. There is also going to be comparisons between apple and android security. 
 
## Evidence
 
## What I did
I searched the timeline of Apple's privacy since 2010 on the website Intego.
I also have compared Apple and Android privacy and researched which one would be stronger for an individuals privacy. 
 
## Reflection
In 2010, Apple changed from a 4 digit password to the option of a 6 digit password. Apple also gave users control over location services per app. In 2014, more location
sercurities were made, including when the device uses wifi nearby to scan for things near the device. This was implented because some stores were watching where the customers
were going, how long they were there, and how frequent they were at the store. In 2015, content blockers were introduced and was widely controversial. In 2025, the Memory
Integrity Enforcement was to created to make spyware attacks more difficult to start and continue. Data encyption is more secure for apple users than android users. Apple
automatically encrypted automatically by default, this makes it harder for anyone to gain information without the correct authentication. Apple takes a more strict approach
to user permissions and privacy controls than android. However, android is always making huge improvements with this. They both have great multi-factor security features. 
For andrioid, devive manufacturers are important to know when getting a device. This is because some devices are more vulnerable than others. Apple has a secure controlled 
hardware for users and their security. For Apple and android it is very important to keeo your deviced up to date with updates that are released to users. I would say Apple
has a better security system than androids. However, individuals can do many things to keep their information secure and private.
